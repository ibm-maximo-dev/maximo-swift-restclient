# MaximoRESTClient

This simple Android Kotlin application demonstrates how easily developers and business partners can build their own solutions by leveraging the Maximo REST APIs. This tutorial shows how to use these APIs and provides instructions for building and testing developed applications.

## Pre-requisites

- Xcode
- Cocoapods
- Maximo 7.6

## Getting Started

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the directory that contains your Xcode project.
```
Now at this point, if your project is already configured to use Cocoapods, you can skip the next step.
```

2. Next, enter the following command:
```
pod init
```

3. Finally, type the following command to open the Podfile using Xcode for editing:
```
open -a Xcode Podfile
```

The default Podfile looks like this:

```
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target '<YOUR PROJECT NAME>' do
  # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for <YOUR PROJECT NAME>

end
```

Delete the # and space before platform, and delete the other lines starting with #.
Your Podfile should now look like this:

```
platform :ios, '9.0'

target '<YOUR PROJECT NAME>' do
  use_frameworks!

end
```
4. Add the following line to your Podfile, right after use_frameworks!:
```
pod 'MaximoRESTClient', '1.0.0'
```

5. You now need to tell CocoaPods to install the dependencies for your project.
Enter the following command in Terminal:
```
pod install
```

6. After the dependencies have been successfully installed, Cocoapods creates a new <YOUR PROJECT NAME>.xcworkspace file and a Pods folder that contains all the project's dependencies.
Now just open the .xcworkspace file with Xcode and you are all set!
